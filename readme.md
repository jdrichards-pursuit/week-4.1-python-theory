## Overview

This lesson introduces fundamental data structures and control flow concepts in Python, with comparisons to JavaScript. It covers lists, tuples, dictionaries, and loops, providing a solid foundation for working with collections and iterating over data in Python. 

## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

1. Create and manipulate lists in Python
2. Understand list methods and how they compare to JavaScript array methods
3. Use list slicing and list comprehensions effectively
4. Create and work with tuples, understanding their immutable nature
5. Differentiate between when to use lists versus tuples in Python
6. Implement various types of loops in Python, including for loops
7. Understand the differences between Python and JavaScript loops
8. Utilize `range()`, `enumerate()`, and indexing in loops
9. Create and manipulate dictionaries in Python
10. Compare dictionary methods to JavaScript object methods
11. Recognize the similarities and differences between Python's data structures and their JavaScript counterparts
